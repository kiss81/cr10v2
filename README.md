# creality cr10v2
My creality cr-10 v2 profiles for slic3r. 
Initialy these profiles are made for PLA upto 0.15 layer height. Speed and temperature settings are tuned for my situation where I prefer quality over speed in general. 
These can give other cr-10 v2 owners a good starting point, so feel free to use this.

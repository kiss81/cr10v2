# creality cr10v2

This repo contains:
My creality cr-10 v2 stock Marlin 2.0.5.3 Vanila configurations files. (no bltouch) in the "marlin" folder

My creality cr-10 v2 profiles for slic3r. Currently working with a swiss tech coated 0.3mm nozzle. Which prints very neat right now I would say.

Feel free to use this as a starting point for your own profiles / firmware build.
